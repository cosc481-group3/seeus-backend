# Installs a python dependency
# This will run in the web container, so developers do not have to have python or pipenv installed locally
# It will modify Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, so dependency changes can still be tracked in git
# Note: --system flag is needed so dependencies are installed at system level in the container

docker-compose run --rm web pipenv install "$@"
